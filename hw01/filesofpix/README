Acknowledgments: 
----------------
We used help from TAs during office hours, and used stack overflow for help
dealing with syntax errors and learning about c libraries for things like
malloc, strcmp, and stderr output.


Implementations:
----------------
Readaline has been fully implemented to work with files 1000 characters or
less. The same goes for the rest of our functions that rely on readaline. 
Restoration.c contains the main function for the program, and the rest of
our helper functions are defined in sequences.h and implemented in sequences.c.
We are managing to free all our sequences, but are still getting memory leaks 
from valgrind due to our malloc pointers that we didn't figure out how to free
without losing data we still needed from them.


Hours Spent: 
------------
Around 20 hours total so far.
