Acknowledgments: 
----------------
We used help from many TAs during office hours, the Hanson textbook for 
understanding various Hanson structure implementations, and course references
for the pnm reader interface.


Implementations:
----------------
Both our Bit2 and UArray2 .c and .h files are completed and passing all the
tests we've given them so far without any memory leaks. Sudoku is also fully
implemented to the specifications from the spec. Unblackedges is able to take
input, check if its a pbm file, read it in, and output the Bit2 back into 
pbm format. It is able to find the outer black edges, but has not been able to
unblack the black edges towards the center of the pbm.


Hours Spent: 
------------
Around 15-20 hours total.
