Architecture: 
----------------
Our bitpack.c file contains our implementations for the six bitpack functions
used in the compression and decompression process. Our compress40.c file
contains all the other function definitions and implementations used for
compression and decompression, with the compression functions together and the
decompression functions below them.


Acknowledgments: 
----------------
We used help from many TAs during office hours (thank you), the solution
implementations for files from past homeworks, and course references for 
the various confusing bitpack operators.


Implementations:
----------------
Our bitpack.c is fully implemented and has passed all of the unit tests we've
given it so far. Our compress40.c is fully implemented and can handle both 
the -c and -d commands, both of which pass fully pass valgrind. Our ppmdiff 
is also implemented and working, and we currently are getting a score of
0.0196 when ran on flowers.ppm.


Hours Spent: 
------------
Around 10 hours spent analyzing.
Around 12 hours spent solving.
